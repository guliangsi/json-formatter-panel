# JSON Formatter Panel

The JSON Formatter panel allows you to display JSON field from an Elasticsearch document on a dashboard as pretty JSON.
It also works with a non-json field, the panel displays it in string format.

This panel requires configuring the name of the field to be displayed in Panel/Display under 'Name of field to display'
